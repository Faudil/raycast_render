raycast render
==

This project was first a school project but I had a lot of fun doing it so I created a few bonuses.


##Usage
To launch it once compiled just type :
> ./raycast_render file_map

If you want to launch it in creative mod :
> ./raycast_render -c file_name map_width map_height

##Keymap

Use **ZSQD** to move around the map
**R** activate/desactivate reflection on the ground
**C** to enter in creative mode
**space** to destroy a cube once in creative mode
**E** to create a block
**1234567** to change the color of the block you want to create
**Enter** to save the map only if you launch the programm with the -c flag

##Dependencies :
+ csfml
+ lib math
+ glibc
+ use a Makefile to compile
